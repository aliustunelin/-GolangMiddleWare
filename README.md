Gin-Gonic is a light but high-performance HTTP-Web-Framework.<br> Look another HTTP freamworks: https://deepsource.io/blog/go-web-frameworks/



Then the system is full capacity, of course only for 3 servers :) 
<br>
for testing we can run 5001, 5002, 5003 http-servers
```
>> npx http-server -p 5002
>> npx http-server -p 5003
```

## Project Addition Development
- For project development, it is possible to switch to http instead of TCP-IP.
- Currently not ideal for use in any living system.
- Concurrency, efficient memory usage etc. Many parts need improvements.
- Many proxy load balancers can be found in Github.
